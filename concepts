Use of Bit wise in programming:

BinaryLeftshift operator: When you apply binary left shift on number that means you are multiplying number by 2.
BinaryRightShift operator: When you apply binary right shift on number that means you are dividing number by 2.

Binary of even-number ends with 0 & odd-number ends with 1.
This above concept can be use to check whether numberis even or odd by making AND of number with binary representation of number 1.

Swap two number using bitwise operator

Use of dynamic programming:

DP is Enhanced Recursion.
Problem is said to be DP when you see choice in probelm and optimal solution required(i.e. max, min, largest, smallest). if recursion with overlapping then it said to be DP.

DP = Recursion + storage
DP Process = Recursion -> memoization -> Top-down

How to solve knapsack porblem:
There are some stpes to be followed while implementing knapsack problem:
1) Input type 
2) Return type 
3) Base condition --> think of the smallest valid I/P.
4) Choice Diagram -->
